    <p>
      Scented by briny capers and infused with citrusy white wine (try a
      sauvignon blanc), this artichoke, mushroom, and chicken dinner offers a
      delightful taste of the Mediterranean. If you can find fresh artichokes,
      feel free to trade them in for canned. Either way, you'll get some spring
      vibes from this easy chicken entree.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
      <li>
        1 (14 ounce) can marinated quartered artichoke hearts, drained, liquid
        reserved
      </li>
      <li>1 cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 cup white wine</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon capers</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken with salt and pepper. Heat oil and butter in a large
        skillet over medium heat. Brown chicken in oil and butter for 5 to 7
        minutes per side; remove from skillet, and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place artichoke hearts and mushrooms in the skillet, and saute until
        mushrooms are brown and tender. Return chicken to skillet, and pour in
        reserved artichoke liquid and wine. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for
        about 10 to 15 minutes, until chicken is no longer pink and juices run
        clear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in capers, and simmer for another 5 minutes. Remove from heat;
        serve immediately.
