    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
      This better-than-delivery homemade pizza is topped with arugula, green
      onions, and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Creamy ricotta cheese, savory
      bacon, and spicy red pepper flakes complement the fresh produce
      beautifully atop a store-bought thin pizza crust. It's on the table in
      just 25 minutes.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>4 stalks green onions, sliced diagonally</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) package store-bought thin pizza crust</li>
      <li>5 slices cooked bacon, crumbled, or more to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix ricotta cheese, green onions, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and red pepper
        flakes together in a bowl. Spread over pizza crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a cast iron skillet (large
        enough to hold the pizza crust) over medium heat. Gently place pizza
        crust with ricotta mixture into the skillet. Add bacon and Parmesan
        cheese and cook the bottom of the pizza for 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and bake until the top of the
        pizza begins to brown slightly, 7 to 8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully remove from the oven. Season with salt and pepper, scatter
        arugula over top, then drizzle with lemon juice, in that order. Serve
        warm.
      </li>
    </ol>
